Got it 🚀 Let’s craft a clean, professional, and developer-friendly **README.md** for your project.
This will highlight what your project does, how to run it locally and with Docker, and how CI/CD with GitHub Actions + Docker Hub works.

# 📄 README.md

```markdown
# Flask IP Reverse 🔄

A simple **full-stack Flask application** that collects visitor IP addresses and displays them in reverse order.  
For example:

```

127.0.0.1 → 1.0.0.127

```

This project also demonstrates modern development practices:
- Lightweight **multi-stage Alpine Docker build**
- **Docker Compose** support
- **Persistent SQLite database** for visits
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD** to automatically build and publish images to Docker Hub

---

## 🚀 Features
- Collect and store visitor IP addresses
- Show all visitor IPs in **reverse order**
- SQLite database persistence (`data/visit.db`)
- Ready-to-use Docker and Docker Compose setup
- Automatic Docker image publishing to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)

## 🐳 Run with Docker

### Build and run directly

```bash
docker build -t flask-ip-reverse:1.0 .
docker run -p 5000:5000 flask-ip-reverse:1.0
```

### Run with Docker Compose

## ☁️ Deploy with GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

This repo includes a workflow: `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`

* On **push to `main`** → builds and pushes:

  * `docker.io/<your-username>/flask-ip-reverse:latest`
  * `docker.io/<your-username>/flask-ip-reverse:<commit-sha>`

* On **push of Git tag (e.g. `v1.0.0`)** → also publishes:

  * `docker.io/<your-username>/flask-ip-reverse:1.0.0`

### Example

```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

✅ This README is **beginner-friendly**, looks professional, and shows off your Docker + CI/CD setup.  

Do you want me to also include **badges** (Docker Hub pulls, CI status, license, etc.) at the top for extra polish?
